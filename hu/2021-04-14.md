### Már több mint 3 millióan kaptak oltást

Dear Sir / Madam,

The number of vaccinated people in Hungary is constantly growing. More than 3 million of our compatriots have already received the vaccine. According to the World Health Organization, last week Hungary had the fastest vaccination rate not only in Europe but all over the world. This is also due to the availability of several vaccines.

Ninety percent of registered seniors have already been vaccinated. In many GP practices, therefore, all registered citizens, regardless of age, are already called for vaccination. Their vaccination schedule is decided by the GPs. Vaccines are also being vaccinated, with 80 percent of those working in public education already receiving the vaccine.

In recent times, anti-vaccination voices have intensified again. Please don't listen to them! All vaccines are effective and safe.

If you have a friend who is not yet registered, please encourage them to do so! The vaccine saved lives.


Sincerely:

Coronavirus Information Center
