### Statistics on each type of vaccine

Dear Sir / Madam,

Vaccination groups continue their campaign in several ways. One form of this is to question the effectiveness of certain types of vaccines. Therefore, the government released post-vaccination infection and mortality data.

These data clearly show that the incidence of disease is less than one percent after each vaccine. This shows that all vaccines used in Hungary are effective and protect against infection.

You can view aggregate statistics on this page.

We ask everyone to take the opportunity to get vaccinated! The vaccine saved lives.

Sincerely:

Government Information Center
