### Information on Sunday's referendum

Dear Lady/Lord,

Today, when there is a war in our neighborhood, the most important question is whether Hungary gets involved in the war or stays out of it. This is what the majority of Hungarians are concerned about.

Our goal is to continue to keep our country safe. Our future also depends on our ability to protect our children.

On 3 April (this Sunday) we will hold a referendum on the protection of children. We believe that children  The right to have sex education belongs exclusively to the parents. Others would also grant this right to activist groups.

We respect the decision of every Hungarian about how they live their lives as adults. Child protection is a state duty. It should not happen that activist groups in schools, television shows and advertisements engage in sexual propaganda aimed at children!

Since there has been a strong debate on this issue, the government is giving all Hungarians the opportunity to express their views. This is what the referendum serves.

The following questions can be answered in the referendum:

* Do you support the holding of a sexual orientation session for minor children in a public educational institution without the consent of the parent?
* Do you support promoting gender reassignment treatments for underage children?
* Do you support the introduction of sexual media content to minor children that affects their development without restrictions?
* Do you support showing media to minors showing gender change?

Now we can stop sexual propaganda aimed at children! Therefore Please take part in the referendum and vote 4 against.

Let us protect our children.


Yours sincerely:
Government Information Centre
