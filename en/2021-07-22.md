### Consultation on life after the epidemic

Dear Sir / Madam!

The government has launched a national consultation on life after the epidemic. We are living in an age of dangers: we have to face not only epidemics, but also migratory pressures and economic challenges. We would like points of agreement to be established in Hungary on the most important issues in this regard. The consultation serves this purpose.

The questionnaire includes several topics: participants can also express their opinions on the minimum wage of HUF 200,000, the family tax refund, the Child Protection Act and certain migration issues.

The questionnaire can also be returned by post and completed online at:

Your opinion also matters, please fill in the questionnaire yourself!

Best regards:

Government Information Center
