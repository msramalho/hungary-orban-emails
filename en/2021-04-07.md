### 2.5 million vaccinated, first steps in restart

Dear Sir / Madam!

Hungary remains at the forefront of vaccination in Europe. The number of people vaccinated this week exceeds 2.5 million. This allows us to take the first steps towards a gradual restart of life under strict safety rules. Accordingly:

- the curfew is amended for the period from 10 am to 5 pm;

- shops can be open from 5 am to 9:30 am

- shops, including those closed since 8 March, may be open according to strict rules: on average, there may be 1 customer per 10 square meters in the shop;

- temporary protection measures related to services will be abolished, so hairdressers and cosmetics may be opened;

- takeaway service is still only possible in restaurants, guests can only enter restaurants for the necessary time;

- schools and kindergartens may reopen on 19 April following the vaccination of teachers.

More than 3 million 840,000 have already registered to be vaccinated. According to the vaccination plan, all our compatriots who have registered so far can receive the vaccine until May.

In the meantime, let's take care of each other!


Sincerely:
Coronavirus Information Center
