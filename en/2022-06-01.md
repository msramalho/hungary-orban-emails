### Hungary is exempt from the oil embargo

Dear Sir / Madam!

We defended overhead cuts at the last EU summit. We have blocked a proposal in Brussels that would have banned the use of oil from Russia in Hungary. Under the agreement, countries that receive oil by pipeline will continue to operate under the old conditions.

Energy prices are already high in the European Union and inflation is high. Because of sanctions, the whole of Europe is dancing on the brink of a global economic crisis. Under such circumstances, it would have been unbearable for us if we had to run the Hungarian economy with more expensive oil. This would have amounted to an atomic bomb dropped on the Hungarian economy. Adopting the original Brussels package would have increased the price of fuel by 55 to 60 percent, which would have pushed up the price of other products further.

The Hungarian position has been clear from the beginning: we condemn Russia's military intervention, we offer a helping hand to those in trouble from Ukraine, but we still cannot allow the Hungarian people to pay the price of the war.

Sincerely:
Government Information Center
