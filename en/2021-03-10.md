### More than one million have already been vaccinated


Dear Sir / Madam!

More than one million of our compatriots have already been vaccinated against the coronavirus. In terms of population, Hungary is the second best performing country in the European Union. Almost twice as many people have received the vaccine in Hungary as in European countries on average.

This is due to the fact that we already use five types of vaccines in the domestic vaccination program. More shipments will arrive in the coming weeks, so the vaccination program will continue to accelerate.
Detailed statistics on vaccination coverage in EU countries can be found on this page.

Experts agree that the epidemic can only be curbed by vaccination. Already 3 million 30 thousand have indicated that they want to take advantage of the opportunity. If you have a family member or acquaintance who is not yet registered, please encourage them to do so. The vaccine saved lives.

Together we will succeed again!


Sincerely:
Coronavirus Information Center
