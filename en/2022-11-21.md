### The consultation on sanctions can already be completed online

Dear Sir / Madam!

The consultation on Brussels sanctions can already be completed online. These are issues that affect the lives of all of us.

In Brussels, they promised that the sanctions would end the war. However, the war is not over, energy prices have skyrocketed, food prices are rising, and inflation has risen to a level not seen for decades. Despite the clear consequences, they want to have new sanctions accepted.

We condemn Russia's military aggression, we help the refugees coming from Ukraine, but we cannot allow the sanctions to bury the economy of Hungary, or even the whole of Europe.

A change of direction is needed. If many of us participate in the consultation, we can achieve this. Therefore, please tell us your opinion!

You can access the consultation questionnaire at the following link:

Sincerely:
Government Information Center
