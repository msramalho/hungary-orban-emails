### Further steps in restarting 5.5 million vaccinated

Dear Sir / Madam!

We are pleased to inform you that the number of people vaccinated in Hungary has exceeded 5.5 million. This allows us to release a significant part of the restrictions.

- Mask wearing is no longer mandatory (with the exception of social institutions and hospitals).
- You can enter catering shops, accommodation, leisure facilities and cultural events with a forward-facing auditorium without a security certificate.
- Restrictions on shops will be lifted.
- At family events and private events, the current limit of 50 people will increase to 100 people, and in the case of weddings, the number limit of 200 people will increase to 400 people.

Sports events, music-dance events and other events held indoors or for more than 500 people outdoors can still only be attended with a security certificate.

More information is available here.

There are several vaccines available in Hungary, so everyone who wants to can get the vaccine. The registration website (https://vakcinainfo.gov.hu/) and the online appointment book are still available to everyone. If you have a friend who is not yet registered, please encourage them to do so! The vaccine saved lives.

 

Sincerely:

Government Information Center
