### Call for vaccinations

Dear Sir / Madam!

The fourth wave of the coronavirus epidemic reached Hungary as well. The number of patients is growing throughout Europe, including Hungary. The now-spreading delta virus mutant is spreading rapidly and can cause more serious disease. Unvaccinated people are still in the greatest danger.

Vaccine recipients should be advised that protection after vaccination may be reduced after a few months. This is true for all vaccines. Therefore, revaccination is especially important for those who have been vaccinated in the past.

Therefore, if you are over 18 years of age and have taken your previous vaccination more than 4 months ago, you should also apply for the booster third vaccination! You can ask your GP to give you this, and you can also book an appointment with a hospital vaccine online. You can do this on the following page:

The vaccine works, the vaccine has saved lives. Long live it!

Sincerely:

Government Information Center
