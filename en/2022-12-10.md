### You can fill out the consultation on sanctions until December 15

Dear Sir / Madam!

The government has extended the deadline for completing the national consultation on sanctions until December 15.

The oil sanction came into effect a few days ago, and its effects are felt throughout Europe, including Hungary. Instead of changing their policy that caused serious damage, the decision-makers in Brussels want to introduce new sanctions. They would extend the sanctions policy to the gas market and nuclear energy as well. This would further increase the burden on the European economy.

These are issues that affect the lives of all of us. That's why we ask you, if you haven't already, to give us your opinion!

You can fill out the consultation questionnaire on this page:

Sincerely:
Government Information Center
