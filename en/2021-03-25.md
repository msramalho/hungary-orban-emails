### Title

Dear Sir / Madam,

More than 1.7 million of our compatriots have already been vaccinated in Hungary. Hungary is in the second place in the ranking of vaccination countries of the EU countries after Malta. This is mainly due to the fact that there are currently five types of vaccines. In recent days, two more vaccines have been approved by the Hungarian Pharmaceutical Authority (CoviShield, CanSino vaccines). The first shipments of these may arrive in a few weeks.

The third wave of the epidemic is spreading strongly. Due to their age, the elderly were most exposed to the severe course of viral infection. Therefore, they are a priority in the vaccination program. 65% of registered over-65s have already been vaccinated, with the rest coming soon.

We consider it particularly important that our elderly compatriots receive protection as soon as possible. To this end, all citizens over the age of 65 who have not yet registered for the vaccine will receive the registration form again by post. (You can also register online at vakcinainfo.gov.hu.)

If you have a family member or acquaintance who has not yet registered for the vaccine, please encourage them to do so! The vaccine saved lives.

Sincerely:

Coronavirus Information Center
