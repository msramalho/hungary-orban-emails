### Results of the national consultation

Dear Sir / Madam!

The government summarized the results of the national consultation, which are clear: 97 percent of Hungarians reject sanctions that cause serious damage.

They said no to oil sanctions, planned gas sanctions, as well as restrictions on nuclear energy. Sanctions that further increase food prices or place additional burdens on European tourism were also rejected.


We would like to thank the 1,389,000 people who participated in the consultation.

Their message is clear: the Brussels sanctions policy must be reviewed! What is needed are not misguided sanctions, but peace negotiations as soon as possible. The government will try to enforce this.

Sincerely:
Government Information Center
