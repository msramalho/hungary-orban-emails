### Information about the booster vaccination and the vaccination action week

Dear Sir / Madam!

The fourth wave of the coronavirus epidemic is taking place in Hungary as well. The virus spreads quickly and infects many.

Vaccines older than 4 months are asked to take the third booster dose. To this end, the government is organizing a vaccination action week between 22 November (Monday) and 28 November (Sunday). Vaccination can be taken on these days without a prior appointment. In this case, the vaccine will be given in order of arrival.

Hospital vaccines are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. In addition to the third booster dose, applicants may receive either the first or missed second vaccine.

You can find the contact details of the vaccines and all the important information on this page:

Those who have not yet taken the opportunity to be vaccinated at all, please do not delay the decision to apply for the vaccine to protect yourself and those around you!

The vaccine works, the vaccine has saved lives.

Sincerely:

Government Information Center
