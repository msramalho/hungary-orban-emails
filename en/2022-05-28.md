### Information on the decision of the new government

Dear Sir / Madam!

A new government has been formed. We consider it our most important task to preserve the security of our country and to protect Hungarian families from the harmful economic consequences of the war. We need to protect the overhead reduction and strengthen the military.

In order to achieve these goals, the Cabinet has made important decisions. In the budget for 2022 and 2023, we will create a fund for defense and a defense fund. From these we will finance the maintenance of overhead cuts and the strengthening of national defense. We will oblige large companies that have been making large profits in the recent past to pay most of their extra profits into these two funds. We expect them to contribute to the protection of the country in this way.

We have to reckon with the fact that the Russo-Ukrainian war will not end any time soon. Prolonged conflict is causing energy prices to rise across Europe, which will significantly increase inflation. Even in these circumstances, we will do everything we can to provide protection for families. After that, we will not allow the Hungarian people to pay the price of the war either!

Sincerely:
Government Information Center
