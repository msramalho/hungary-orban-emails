### This is how you can help those in need

Dear Compatriot!

What we all wanted to avoid has happened: there is a war going on in our neighborhood. We will do everything we can to ensure that our country does not drift into the armed conflict, because the security of the Hungarian people is the first.

We work for peace, while extending a helping hand to those in need. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes due to the Russo-Ukrainian war: Hungarians and Ukrainians in Transcarpathia.

We can be proud that an exemplary collaboration has been established in Hungary to help them. Once again, we can prove that this is a good country inhabited by good people.

We have launched a special relief operation to help those who have remained in Ukraine and those who need asylum in our country.

You can also participate in the Bridge for Transcarpathia relief program. The 1357 national helpline was launched, and an account number was opened to collect donations.

Please support the cooperation as much as possible!

Let us preserve the peace of our country and lend a helping hand to those who need it most now!


Sincerely:
Viktor Orban
Prime Minister
