### Thanks

Dear Compatriot!

I would like to thank everyone who took part in the parliamentary elections and the referendum on 3 April. High participation proves the strength of Hungarian democracy and ensures the strong authority of the newly formed Parliament.

The results are clear. Hungarians want peace and security. The new government will work by all possible means to enforce their will.

We have faced many difficulties in recent years, but together we have always managed to overcome them. All Hungarians can count on the government, regardless of which party they trusted and where they live in the country.

Sincerely:
Viktor Orban
Prime Minister
